# vatedroid
vatedroid (v8 droid) is a basic sample project demonstrating how to embed v8 in an android application through the android ndk


## requirements

* the v8 source

* Android SDK

* Android NDK

## instructions

1. create an android project with the vatedroid source

    android update project --name vatedroid --target <your call>

2. compile the v8 source with for the android arm architecture

run the following from the root directory of the v8 source

    make android_arm.releas

3. locate the v8 libraries generated by building v8

they are buried, start looking in

    path/to/v8/out/android_arm.release/obj.target/

4. copy the v8 static libraries to the libs directory of the android project

copy both libv8_base.a and libv8_nosnapshot.a with something like the following

    cp path/to/the/v8/libs/libv8_base.a path/to/your/android/project/libs/libv8_base.a

5. build the ndk shared library

    ndk-build

the ndk root directory must be availabe on your path for the above to work

6. build the android project

    ant debug

or

    ant release

7. install on device or simulator

    adb install <project.apk>

where project.apk is the filename ofthe apk file generated by the previous build step.
